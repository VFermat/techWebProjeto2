## Starting the application

### BackEnd

You have to initialize every microservice and start the thread for all of them.

On terminal:
```shell
cd Back/<serviceName>
yarn
nodemon <fileName>
```

Nodemon is a watcher that makes sure the code that is running is the most recent one!

### FrontEnd

You have to initialize the application and start it. I altered the built in scrip for yarn to make sure everything is installed when code is initialized!

```shell
cd app
yarn start
```
